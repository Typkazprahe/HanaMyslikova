## Comic books 
Hi! My name is Hana and I am a student of Animation and Visual Effects and today I would like to show you my journey of my interest in comic books.

I've never been deeply into comic books themselves. My passion lies more with superheroes, especially when portrayed in movies and series. That's where I've always found my excitement and connection to the genre.
However, a few months ago, while I was feeling bored at the shopping center, I decided to pay a visit to my favorite store, Comicspoint, and ended up purchasing a few comics, with a particular focus on Marvel titles.

I enjoyed every single comic book i read since then and decided to find out more about how rare every signle one of them can be.

Marvel Comics, like many other comic book publishers, have certain issues or editions that are considered rare and highly sought after by collectors. The rarity of a comic book can be influenced by various factors, including low print runs, special editions, significant historical importance, or iconic first appearances. Here are some examples of rare Marvel comics:

Key First Appearances: Comic books that feature the first appearance of a major character are often highly coveted by collectors. For example, "Amazing Fantasy #15" is incredibly rare and valuable because it marks the debut of Spider-Man, one of Marvel's most iconic characters.

Limited Print Runs: Some comic books have extremely low print runs, making them rare and difficult to find. These can include variant covers, promotional editions, or special event issues. For instance, certain variant covers of popular titles like "The Amazing Spider-Man" or "X-Men" may have limited print runs, making them sought after by collectors.

Historical Significance: Comic books that have historical significance or cultural importance can also be considered rare. This could include issues that introduced groundbreaking storylines, addressed significant social issues, or marked major events in the comic book industry.

Condition and Grading: The condition of a comic book also plays a significant role in its rarity and value. Comics that are in mint condition, with minimal wear and tear, are often more valuable than those in poor condition. Professional grading services, such as the Certified Guaranty Company (CGC), assign grades to comic books based on their condition, which can affect their rarity and market value.

Collector's Editions and Variants: Marvel occasionally releases collector's editions or variant covers of popular titles, which are typically produced in limited quantities and may feature unique artwork or special features. These editions can become rare and highly sought after by collectors.

Promotional and Giveaway Comics: Comic books that were given away as promotional items or part of special events may also be rare, especially if they were distributed in limited quantities or are no longer in circulation.
