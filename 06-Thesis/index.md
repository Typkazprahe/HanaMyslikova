### Introduction
Hey everyone! My name is Hana and I am a student of animation and visual effects. One of my passions is video games and that's why I decided to chose this topic for my presentation and my bachelor thesis

### My topic
I've always been fascinated by animation, games, and related fields. So, when pondering my bachelor thesis, I decided to intertwine two of my greatest passions and delve deeper into them to share what I've discovered.

The primary objectives I aim to convey are:

1. Styles of Animation
2. Types of Video games
3. Leading companies in gaming industry
4. The predominant animation style in video games

### No.1 - Styles of Animation

There are various styles of animation, each with its own unique characteristics. Every single one is difficult in different way and here are some common styles include:

1. **Traditional Animation:** Also known as cel animation, this style involves hand-drawing each frame to create movement.
2. **2D Animation:** This style involves creating images in a two-dimensional space and animating them.
3. **3D Animation:** Utilizing computer software, 3D animation involves creating three-dimensional objects and animating them within a digital environment.
4. **Stop Motion Animation:** This technique involves physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them frame by frame to create the illusion of movement.
5. **Claymation:** A type of stop motion animation where characters and objects are sculpted from clay or similar materials.
6. **Cutout Animation:** This style involves using pre-existing images or characters cut out from paper or other materials and animating them.
7. **Motion Graphics:** Combining graphic design elements with animation to convey information or create visual effects.
8. **Anime:** Originating from Japan, anime is a distinctive style characterized by colorful artwork, fantastical themes, and vibrant characters.
9. **Pixel Art:** Utilizing pixels as the basic building blocks, this style involves creating images and animations at a low resolution, often seen in retro video games.
10. **Experimental Animation:** Pushing the boundaries of traditional animation techniques to create abstract or avant-garde works of art.

### No.4 - The predominant animation style in video games

The predominant animation style in video games varies depending on factors like technological advancements, artistic preferences, and gameplay requirements. However, one of the most common animation styles found in many modern video games is 3D animation.

3D animation involves creating and manipulating three-dimensional objects within a digital environment. It allows for greater realism and depth compared to traditional 2D animation. Here are some key features and reasons why 3D animation is prevalent in video games:

***Realism*** 3D animation enables developers to create lifelike characters, environments, and objects. This realism enhances immersion and allows players to engage more deeply with the game world

***Flexibility*** 3D animation provides developers with greater flexibility in terms of character movements, camera angles, and environmental effects. This versatility allows for more dynamic and engaging gameplay experiences.

***Scalability*** 3D animation is scalable, meaning it can be adapted to various screen sizes and resolutions without losing quality. This makes it suitable for a wide range of gaming platforms, from consoles and PCs to mobile devices and virtual reality systems.

***Interactivity*** 3D animation lends itself well to interactive storytelling and gameplay mechanics. Developers can create interactive cutscenes, realistic physics simulations, and complex character interactions that enhance player immersion and agency.

***Technological Advances*** in computer graphics technology have made 3D animation more accessible and efficient for game developers. Powerful game engines and animation software allow for the creation of stunning visual effects and lifelike character animations.
