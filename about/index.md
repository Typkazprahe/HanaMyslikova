## Me and my backstory
Hello! My name is Hana and right now I am student of Animation. Choosing one way to describe myself is pretty tricky since I'm still on a journey of self-discovery. 
However I can tell you more about me and what I like to do.

Besides animation, I enjoy engaging in several other activities. Of all these, my favorites are gaming, painting, and dancing. I can be a very energetic person with understanding for everyone. 

In my youth, I was incredibly athletic, engaging in basketball for a span of nine years, participating in soccer for two, and presently immersing myself in the art of Latin American dancing.
