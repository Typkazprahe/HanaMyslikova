## Me and my backstory
Hello! My name is Hana and right now I am student of Animation. Choosing one way to describe myself is pretty tricky since I'm still on a journey of self-discovery. 
However I can tell you more about me and what I like to do.

Besides animation, I enjoy engaging in several other activities. Of all these, my favorites are gaming, painting, and dancing. I can be a very energetic person with understanding for everyone. 

In my youth, I was incredibly athletic, engaging in basketball for a span of nine years, participating in soccer for two, and presently immersing myself in the art of Latin American dancing.

During my free moments, when all I wanna do is relaxation, I thoroughly enjoy indulging in gaming. A passion that has captivated me since the tender age of four. That also leads to my next hobbie which is video editing. My primary focus involves creating highlights from gaming sessions with friends, and subsequently crafting humorous videos from those moments.

One of my more creatively driven passions is cosplay. With a deep appreciation for movies and games, I took the opportunity to dive into the world of Comiccon when it arrived in Prague. I started to making costumes of characters from games and movies.
