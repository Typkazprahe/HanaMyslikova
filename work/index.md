## Animation 
Over the past seven years, my primary fascination has revolved around the world of animation. This interest was a novel exploration for me from the outset. While I had always harbored a deep appreciation for animated movies and the animation within video games, I had not fully grasped the intricacies and challenges associated with the craft. Following my completion of elementary school, I made a deliberate effort to delve deeper into this field, ultimately leading me to where I am today. My enduring passion for gaming and movies has significantly influenced my work.

Throughout the entirety of my journey in animation, I exclusively engaged in 2D animation, believing it to be my true passion. However, in the past year, a sense of confusion has crept in regarding my genuine aspirations. This uncertainty prompted me to embark on the path of learning 3D animation, hoping to gain clarity on my creative direction.

## Paintings / Drawings
Nevertheless, painting and drawing have been lifelong passions for me, extending beyond my primary interest. Over the past few years, I've delved into the realm of oil painting, finding it to be a technique that resonates with me the most. While it may not be a pursuit I can rely on for a livelihood, the love I have for painting is a driving force behind my desire to continually improve and refine my skills.

## Illustrations
Despite thinking that I've found my passion, I'm still grappling with the challenge of having numerous hobbies. Graphic design and illustration are among them, and I thoroughly enjoy creating new designs. However, I find myself uncertain about my ultimate career path.
