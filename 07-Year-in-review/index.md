# Year in review 

Honestly I feel like my last year was a mess and excitment at the same time. My major challenge centered around college, yet now I find myself in a place of clarity, knowing what lies ahead.

## What happend?

My first point is of course collage. Last year was a whirlwind of tasks and responsibilities, which could be quite challenging. Procrastination emerged as a significant obstacle for me, as I mistakenly believed I had all the time in the world. However, reality soon caught up with me, particularly as the deadline for my bachelor's thesis loomed closer and closer.
As this year began, I came to the stark realization that time was not on my side, especially when it came to completing the animation and written components of my thesis. Despite my best efforts, success remained elusive. I found myself pondering the future and feeling uncertain about what lay ahead. A conversation with my animation professor shed some light on my situation.. he suggested extending my studies by a semester to allow for more time to consider my next steps in life. Firstable I was really NOT into it. I wanted to finish my collage as soon as possible, to make my family proud and to start my adult life. But after some days of thinking.. I realized it is not bad idea at all! 

An additional semester offers the opportunity to regroup and refine my animation to the standard I initially envisioned. However, my parents weren't particularly supportive of this idea. They urged me to maximize my workload, hoping to expedite the process. Unfortunately, the reality was starkly different.. time was simply not on my side. Eventually, they reluctantly acquiesced, albeit amidst days filled with tension and disagreements.

Another factor that significantly shortened my time was juggling multiple jobs. Managing them all became quite draining after a while. Nonetheless, I believe this experience will ultimately fortify me.

Despite the challenges, there are bright spots to be found. My relationship with my boyfriend has blossomed over the past year, growing stronger with each passing day. Together, we cherish every moment and his presence enriches my life in countless ways. Moreover, I've had the pleasure of forging new and meaningful friendships, which have added depth and richness to my experiences. I find joy in every glimmer of positivity, recognizing that these moments are what truly make life beautiful.
